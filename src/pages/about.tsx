                <p className="aboutPage-para">
                    I am an Electronic Engineer with a strong understanding of Circuit Design, Hardware Design, 
                    and Computer Aided Design gained through my degree at Kingâ€™s College London and hands-on experience in academic and industrial settings. 
                    During my final year at university, 
                    I completed an individual research project designing, testing and building Variable Impedance Actuators (VIAs).
